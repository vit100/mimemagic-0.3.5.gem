`mimemagic-0.3.5.gem` was deleted by owner/developer due to some 
licencing issues - don't know details - google it.

I need this package for one legacy system.

So just to keep it available it is here.

To install mimemagic-0.3.5.gem on your system:

```
git clone https://github.com/vit100/mimemagic-0.3.5.gem.git

 cd mimemagic-0.3.5.gem
 gem install mimemagic-0.3.5.gem
